- 4898fbd: Fix risk classifier to resolve the most sensitive class for compound operation names

  Multi-token operation names whose first matching keyword was a read verb
  (search/find/get/list) were classified as `read` even when the name also
  contained a mutating verb token (e.g. `searchAndReplace`, `findAndReplace`).
  The classifier now collects all risk classes matched by any token in the name
  and returns the most sensitive, so a name carrying both a read token and a
  write token correctly resolves to `write`.

  Several mutation verbs that appear as non-leading tokens (`replace`, `reorder`,
  `rewrite`, `normalize`, `sanitize`, `toggle`, `apply`, `commit`, `flush`,
  `patch`, `transform`, `convert`, `merge`, `assign`) are added to the `write`
  keyword table.

  Five operations across four app packages that were over-gated as `execute`
  (the safe default for unknown ops) are correctly reclassified as `write`:
  `toggleHotkeyWindow` (iTerm), `replace` (Microsoft Word), `convert` (Music, TV),
  and `assign` (OmniPlan). Affected capability metadata regenerated.
