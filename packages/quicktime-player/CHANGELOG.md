### Minor Changes

- a746285: `bindReference` now accepts only resource keys a reference can resolve through, and generated contracts expose their resource table's type.

  Each generated contract exports the type of its resource table as `<App>Resources` (for example `NotesResources`), and the contract is typed `AppContract<<App>Client, <App>Resources>`. The type declares one entry per resource: each builds on `ResourceDescriptor<Record, Id>` and requires the identifier and the literal `get` and `list` operation ids the resource has. The table value is checked against it with `satisfies`, so the type and the value describe one table. `AppContract` takes the table type as an optional second type argument, so `AppContract<Client>` still means a contract whose table keys are not known. Both `createClient` factories return `Client & ClientBrand<Resources>`, and each generated client interface extends `ClientBrand<<App>Resources>` (for example `interface NotesClient extends ClientBrand<NotesResources>`), so the client's type carries the contract's table, including a variable or parameter annotated `NotesClient`. The brand exists only in the type; a client has no added property under any key, and its members are still exactly the app's operations.

  A generated resource table now lists only the resources that have a `get` or a `list` operation. No reference to any other resource can be resolved, in any form or position, so encoding and decoding already rejected them; they now fail as references to a resource the app cannot resolve references through. Their record interfaces are still exported.

  `MactsRuntime.resolveReference` (and so the `/references/v1` route) rejects both kinds of unresolvable target with `ValidationError` (`VALIDATION_FAILED`, 400), with an issue at the reference's `resource`. A reference to a resource absent from the contract's table fails with "The reference names no resource of the app.", the issue saying the app has no such resource. A reference to a resource in the table that has no `get` (for a single reference) or no `list` (for a collection) fails with an issue naming that missing operation. `InvalidSelectionError` is reserved for an index or range the collection cannot satisfy.

  `bindReference(client, data)` reads the table from the client's type. Data type-checks only when every level names a key that records the operation it resolves through: `get` for a single-object reference, a container, and an identity-collection entry, and `list` for a collection. An identity reference needs a resource with an identifier, of the identifier's type. The result is the bound variant for the data's resource, form and cardinality, with the resource's record and identifier types, so `resolve()` returns `Promise<Record>` or `Promise<readonly Record[]>` instead of `unknown`. Where the position takes any container, a container that is itself a reference a client decoded is accepted as it is. At a parent-scoped position, only an identity reference to the parent is accepted. Clients of a contract with no declared table type accept any reference data, as before. `bindReference` behaves as before at runtime. `@macts/contracts` exports the types involved: `ResourceTable`, `ClientBrand`, `ResolvableResourceKey`, `ResolvableReferenceData` (and its object and collection halves), `ResolvableContainment`, `ResourceRecordOf`, `ResourceIdOf`, and `BoundReferenceOf`.

  Generated HTTP clients' list methods return `Page<T>` from `@macts/contracts` instead of an inline `{ items, nextCursor? }` shape, so their items are read-only arrays.

### Patch Changes

- c5a4690: Discovery reports the permission every operation requires. A capability's permission was reported only when the manifest declared one, so most capabilities showed no permission although the server enforces one for every operation. Each capability, in the capability registry, in discovery and CLI search output, and in every generated `capabilities.ts`, now reports the permission the server enforces for its route: the declared one, else the one derived from the route, such as `notes:attachments:get`.
- 80fad3c: The generated HTTP client and CLI now send integer ids and integer list parameters in the contract's wire form, so `get` by an integer id works through them.

  A get keyed by an integer id, such as OmniPlan's tasks, resources and milestones or TV's browser and playlist windows, sent the id as the text it was given, and the operation's input rejected it. The client's `get` now takes the id as a number or as text and sends `{ integer: "<digits>" }`. A list's required integer parameter is sent the same way, and the CLI's `list` converts the flag's text to a number. So are a delete's and an update's integer ids and every integer parameter of a command, such as Automator `add`'s `atIndex`, Word `insertText`'s `at` and `createRange`'s `start` and `end`, QuickTime Player's step `by`, System Events' `usingActionNumber` and Xcode `attach`'s `toProcessIdentifier`. An optional integer that is omitted is not sent.

  Required integer list flags and page-size flags validate their original text before exact conversion to the numeric SDK input, so fractional boundary values and noncanonical spellings cannot change the selected scope.

  Malformed, fractional, non-finite, and out-of-range integer inputs now fail locally with `ValidationError` before any HTTP request. Text identifiers must use canonical decimal spelling; numeric negative zero is sent as zero. The safe-integer bounds and validation policy come from the shared operation value contract.

  Standalone CLI plugin manifests also declare the shared contract runtime directly, so integer validation resolves under isolated dependency installation.
